# Pathak's DSA Bank
This is (definitely not a complete) list of interesting DSA problems I've solved.<br>
I made this to keep track of interesting questions I solve, have all my solutions in one place for easy access, and stay consistent I guess - don't want this repo to go dead. :))<br><br>
You can find questions from various sources here - I started this repository to store my solutions for Striverr's A-Z DSA Sheet (450+ questions). Soon, however, I started keeping all my solutions here, including my daily streak questions, questions from Neetcode's 150, and even Arsh Goyal's 45-Day Challenge.

Some thing I'd like to do to this repository when I get time - mention which problems belong to Striverr's A-Z DSA Sheet, just like I've mentioned (Part of Neetcode 150) or (Part of Arsh Goyal's 45-Day Challenge)
